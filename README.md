Automatic-Control-System
========================

1.Use knowledge-based approach to design a control system to direct manufacturing process using formard reasoning inference
engine provide by CLIPS Expert System Shell.  Which is shown in facts.CLP and rules.CLP.

How to execute this project
(1) First load the "facts.clp" , which contains the sample data set.
(2) Then load the "rules.clp", which contains the knowledge base.
(3) type "(reset)" on the screen
(4) type "(run)" on the screen. 

Then the knowledge base is executed and you can see the result on the screen.



2.Develop an alternative to improve the performance of the system. Which is shown in 2MSET1.clp, 2MSET2.clp, 2MSET3.clp, 
2MSET4.clp,2DST1.clp, 2DST2.clp, 2DST3.clp, 2DST4.clp, and Rules2.clp


How to execute this project
	Rules2.clp contains the rules for final project, 
	2MSET1.clp, 2MSET2.clp, 2MSET3.clp, 2MSET4.clp contain the data set about machine for final project,
	2DST1.clp, 2DST2.clp, 2DST3.clp, 2DST4.clp contain the data set about order for final project.
    
     (i) load the data set about machine (choose one from 2MSET1.clp, 2MSET2.clp, 2MSET3.clp, 2MSET4.clp)
     (ii)load the data set about order (choose one from 2DST1.clp, 2DST2.clp, 2DST3.clp, 2DST4.clp)
     (iii)load the knowledge base Rules2.clp.
     (iv) type "(reset)"
     (v)  type "(run)"
